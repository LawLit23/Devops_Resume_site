ðŸš€ AWS Web Application Deployment with Terraform

This project automates the deployment of a scalable web application on AWS using Terraform. It provisions a complete infrastructure stack, including:
	â€¢	A custom VPC with public/private subnets
	â€¢	EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
	â€¢	Route 53 DNS integration to map a custom domain
	â€¢	Security groups, IAM roles, and user data for full automation

Ideal for demonstrating infrastructure-as-code (IaC) best practices and launching production-ready applications in the cloud.
